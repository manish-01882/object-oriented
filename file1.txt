If you’re a speed-reading novice, try the “pointer method,” which involves following the words with your fingertip as you read them, 
similar to what a child might do. There are a few words for this, like “hand pacing” and “meta guiding,” but the point of it 
(pun intended) is to have you focusing, reading intentionally, and focusing on words and their meanings, even when you’re moving fast.
It keeps you engaged and helps you stay on task. If it’s not having the effect you’re looking for, try underlining the sentences with a pen as you go.
